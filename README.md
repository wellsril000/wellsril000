## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currenty studying at Brigham Young University in the Information Systems Program in the Marriot School of Business.
I'm passionate about Data analytics. Especially when using information to make data-driven decisions to improve business. 
Outside of school I love spending time outside. I espeically love rock climbing, mountain biking, and skiing. 
I am looking for internships and job opportunities in tech where I can put my skills and knowledge to practice in real world application.
